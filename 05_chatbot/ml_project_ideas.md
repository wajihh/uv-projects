## You

prepare a projects based roadmap starting from simple to advanced projects to build a portfolio as a machine learning engineer

## Assistant

Sure, here is a suggested roadmap starting from simple to more advanced machine learning projects to build a strong portfolio:

1. **Project 1: Predicting Housing Prices**
   * Dataset: Use a dataset containing housing prices and features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, size, etc.
   * Task: Develop a linear regression model to predict house prices based on the features.

2. **Project 2: Sentiment Analysis**
   * Dataset: Use a dataset of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative sentiment.
   * Task: Build a text classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict sentiment of reviews.

3. **Project 3: Image Classification**
   * Dataset: MNIST dataset of handwritten digits or CIFAR-10 dataset of various objects.
   * Task: Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images into respective categories.

4. **Project 4: Customer Churn Prediction**
   * Dataset: Use a dataset containing customer information and whether they churned or not.
   * Task: Create a classification model to predict customer churn using techniques like Random Forest or XGBoost.

5. **Project 5: Recommender System**
   * Dataset: MovieLens dataset or any other recommendation dataset.
   * Task: Build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering or matrix factorization techniques.

6. **Project 6: Time Series Forecasting**
   * Dataset: Use a dataset containing time series data like stock prices, weather data, etc.
   * Task: Develop a model using techniques like ARIMA or LSTM to forecast future values based on historical data.

7. **Project 7: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**
   * Task: Implement a GAN architecture for image generation tasks such as generating new handwritten digits or generating images of faces.

8. **Project 8: Reinforcement Learning**
   * Task: Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm like Q-learning or Deep Q Network for a simple game or environment.

By completing these projects, you will showcase a variety of machine learning techniques and build a diverse portfolio demonstrating your skills as a machine learning engineer. Make sure to document your process, results, and insights gained from each project to present in your portfolio. Good luck with your projects!
