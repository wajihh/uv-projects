A program that:
Imports the random module
Uses a loop to generate 10 random numbers
Uses random.randint(1, 100) to get random numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
Prints each number with a space after it using end=' '
Adds a newline at the end
You can run this program multiple times, and each time you'll get a different set of random numbers between 1 and 100. The numbers will be printed on a single line with spaces between them, just like in your example output.
